<h1>~Types of Artificial Intelligence:</h1>
<img src="types.jpeg" style="float: right;" width= "50%;">
<h2>First of all, the categorization of Artificial Intelligence is into four types. Arend Hintze came up with this categorization. The categories are as follows:</h2>

<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">-Type 1: Reactive machines : <br>
 hese machines can react to situations. A famous example can be Deep Blue, the IBM chess program. Most noteworthy, the chess program won against Garry Kasparov, the popular chess legend. Furthermore, such machines lack memory. These machines certainly cannot use past experiences to inform future ones. It analyses all possible alternatives and chooses the best one.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;">
	-Type 2: Limited memory: <br>
These AI systems are capable of using past experiences to inform future ones. A good example can be self-driving cars. Such cars have decision making systems. The car makes actions like changing lanes. Most noteworthy, these actions come from observations. There is no permanent storage of these observations.

</p>

<p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: left;"> 
	-Type 3: Theory of mind : <br>
This refers to understand others. Above all, this means to understand that others have their beliefs, intentions, desires, and opinions. However, this type of AI does not exist yet. <br> <br>
-Type 4: Self-awareness : <br>
This is the highest and most sophisticated level of Artificial Intelligence. Such systems have a sense of self. Furthermore, they have awareness, consciousness, and emotions. Obviously, such type of technology does not yet exist. This technology would certainly be a revolution.
